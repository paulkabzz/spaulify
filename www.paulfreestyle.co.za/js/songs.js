    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, darling
    Riding high, when I was king
    Played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
    Walked away, wonderin' then
    But easy come and easy go
    And it would end
    So ah, any time I need ya, let me go
    Every time I reach, you get me low
    Every time I seek, you let me know
    But I planted that seed, just let me grow
    I'm on my knees while I'm (beggin')
    'Cause I don't wanna lose (you)
    I got my arms all spread
    I hope that my heart gets fed
    Matter of fact, girl, I'm beggin' (beggin', beggin')
    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, baby
    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, darling
    I need you (yeah) to understand
    Tried so hard (hey) to be your man
    The kind of man (oh) you want in the end
    Only then can I begin to live again
    An empty shell I used to be
    Shadow of my life was hangin' over me
    A broken man that I don't know
    Won't even stand the devil's chance to win my soul
    What we doing? What we chasing?
    Why the bottom? Why the basement?
    Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
    Why the feel for the need to replace me?
    You're on a runway track from the good
    I wanna paint in a picture telling where we could be at
    Like the heart ain't attached where it should
    You done give it away, I had it 'til you took it back
    But I keep walking on, keep opening doors
    Keep hoping for that the call is yours
    Keep hoes on hold
    'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
    Girl, I'm beggin' (beggin', beggin')
    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, baby
    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, darling
    I'm fighting hard (yeah)
    To hold my own (hold my own)
    Just can't make it
    All alone (all alone)
    I'm holding on (yeah)
    Can't fall back (no, I'm fallin')
    I'm just a con (yeah)
    'Bout to fade to black

    lyrics: `
    Step by step, heart to heart
    Left, right, left, we all fall down...
    Step by step, heart to heart
    Left, right, left, we all fall down
    Like toy soldiers
    Bit by bit, torn apart
    We never win, but the battle wages on
    For toy soldiers
    I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
    Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
    I ain't never supposed to show it
    My crew ain't supposed to know it
    Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
    It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
    'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
    I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
    If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
    That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
    There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
    I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
    It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
    And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
    I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
    And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
    This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
    That was never my object, for someone to get killed
    Why would I wanna destroy somethin' I helped build?
    It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
    I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
    And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
    And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
    Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
    So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
    While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
    Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
    This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
    But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause—
    Step by step, heart to heart
    Left, right, left, we all fall down
    Like toy soldiers
    Bit by bit, torn apart
    We never win, but the battle wages on
    For toy soldiers
    There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
    Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
    But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
    The shit gets escalated—it ain't just words no more, is it?
    It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
    We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
    Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
    And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
    Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
    Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
    Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
    Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
    Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
    Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
    But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
    Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
    Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
    Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
    But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
    That we've just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
    And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
    We still have soldiers that's on the front line
    Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
    Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
    And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
    To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
    It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
    Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
    But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
    It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
    Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
    I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
    But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
    I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
    Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
    I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience
    'Cause—
    Step by step, heart to heart
    Left, right, left, we all fall down
    Like toy soldiers
    Bit by bit, torn apart

    lyrics: `Lately, I've been hard to reach
    I've been too long on my own
    Everybody has a private world
    Where they can be alone
    Are you callin me?
    Are you tryin' to get through?
    Are you reachin' out for me?
    I'm reachin' out for you
    I'm just so fuckin' depressed
    I just can't seem to get out this slump
    If I could just get over this hump
    But I need something to pull me out this dump
    I took my bruises, took my lumps
    Fell down and I got right back up
    But I need that spark to get psyched back up
    In order for me to pick the mic back up
    I don't know how or why or when
    And I ended up in this position I'm in
    I'm startin' to feel distant again
    So I decided just to pick this pen
    Up and tried to make an attempt to vent
    But I just can't admit
    Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
    I need a new outlet
    And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
    But I just can't sit back and wallow
    In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
    I'll be one tough act to follow
    One tough act to follow
    I'll be one tough act to follow
    Here today, gone tomorrow
    But you'd have to walk a thousand miles
    In my shoes, just to see
    What it's like to be me
    I'll be you, let's trade shoes
    Just to see what it'd be like to
    Feel your pain, you feel mine
    Go inside each other's minds
    Just to see what we find
    Look at shit through each other's eyes
    But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
    Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (yeah, so)
    I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor
    Everything's so tense and gloom
    I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
    Of the room, just as soon as
    I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
    So I try to avoid any eye contact
    'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
    For conversation like I want that
    I'm not lookin' for extra attention
    I just wanna be just like you
    Blend in with the rest of the room
    Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
    I don't need no fuckin' manservant
    Tryna follow me around, and wipe my ass
    Laugh at every single joke I crack
    And half of 'em ain't even funny like
    "Ha, Marshall, you're so funny, man
    You should be a comedian, goddamn"
    Unfortunately I am
    I just hide behind the tears of a clown
    So why don't you all sit down
    Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
    Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
    And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
    In my shoes, just to see
    What it's like to be me
    I'll be you, let's trade shoes
    Just to see what it'd be like to
    Feel your pain, you feel mine
    Go inside each other's minds
    Just to see what we find
    Look at shit through each other's eyes
    But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
    Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
    Nobody asked for life to deal us
    With these bullshit hands we're dealt
    We gotta take these cards ourselves
    And flip 'em, don't expect no help
    Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
    Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
    And get up and get my own
    I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
    Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
    For a dad to show up who never did
    I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
    I dreamed of being that cool kid
    Even if it meant actin' stupid
    Aunt Edna always told me
    "Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that"
    Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
    Holding my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
    'Til I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
    I learned my lesson then
    'Cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
    But I already told you my whole life story
    Not just based on my description
    'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
    Is probably 110% different
    I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
    What size you wear? I wear 10's
    Let's see if you can fit your feet
    In my shoes, just to see
    What it's like to be me
    I'll be you, let's trade shoes
    Just to see what it'd be like to
    Feel your pain, you feel mine

    Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)

    I've been too long on my own (oh-oh)

    Yeah, to my babies, stay strong
    Dad'll be home soon
    And to the rest of the world
    God gave you them shoes to fit you
    So put 'em on and wear 'em
    Be yourself, man
    Be proud of who you are
    Even if it sounds corny
    Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful (so)`,

    He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
    We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
    Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop

    I'm the bossman in the suit with no tie
    I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
    Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
    Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
    Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire

    The latest Mercedes, her go-to surprise
    Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize

    Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky

    I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (skrrt)
    Haven't had a sip, that there weed you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, whoa, whoa (yeah, yeah)
    I'm strapped up, I'm cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (doo-doo-doo-doo)
    I'm in the coupe by myself
    I had to kick a door when I was five
    Keep the old ones on the shelf
    Whole sixteen round in the fire
    I'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies
    Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys

    I work and forever try but I'm cursed, so never mind

    And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
    When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream, "Fuck 'em all"!
    Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
    This roof is cavin' in
    Uh, it's time to raise it, then
    Your days are numbered like pages in
    My book of rhymes got 'em cookin'
    Boy, this crooked mind of mine got 'em
    All shook and scared to look in my eyes
    I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I
    Came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
    And butt-fucked this game up
    Better be careful when you bring my name up
    Fuck this fame, that ain't what
    I came to claim but the game ain't
    Gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
    But I swear one way or another
    I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe that
    I swear to God, won't spare the rod
    I'm a man of my word so your fuckin' heads better nod
    Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
    Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
    Permanently, bitch, it's beddy bye
    This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die
    My head is swolle', my confidence is up
    This stage is my pedestal, I'm an unstoppable
    Incredible Hulk - you're trapped in my medicine ball
    I could run circles around you so fast
    Your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
    I split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'
    Pick the world up
    And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head

    Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
    Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
    Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde, nah
    On the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde

    Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
    I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
    I'ma be late for the pity party
    But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
    Took it on the chin like a champ
    So don't lump me in with the chump-ions
    I'm done being your punching bag
    It was the November 31st today
    Would've been our anniversary
    Two years but you left on the 1st of May
    I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
    But couldn't think of the words to say
    But they came to me just now
    So I put 'em in a verse to lay
    And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was
    But I hate you cause you drained me, I gave you all, you gave me none
    But if you blame me, you're crazy and after all is said and done
    I'm still angry, yeah, I may be, I may never trust someone
    But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was
    Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
    And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh
    But I'mma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you"
    Cause I'm stronger than I was`,

    That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
    Yesterday I changed your diaper, wiped you and powdered you
    How did you get so big? Can't believe it, now you're two
    Baby you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
    Sit down bitch! You move again I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay)
    Don't make me wake this baby! She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!
    Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
    How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
    Oh, what's the matter Kim, am I too loud for you?!
    Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
    At first, I'm like: "Aight, you wanna throw me out; that's fine!"
    But not for him to take my place! Are you out your mind?!
    This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
    How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
    Look at your husband now! (No!) I said, look at him!
    He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?!
    (Why are you doing this?!) Shut the fuck up!
    (You're drunk! You're never gonna get away with this!)
    You think I give a fuck?! Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!)
    Sit up front! (We can't just leave Hailie alone! What if she wakes up?)
    We'll be right back; well, I will: you'll be in the trunk!
    So long, bitch you did me so wrong
    I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
    You really fucked me Kim! You really did a number on me!
    Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
    But we was kids then, Kim! I was only eighteen
    That was years ago! I thought we wiped the slate clean
    That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racing
    (I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station!
    I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!)
    There's a year-old little laying dead with a slit throat
    In your living room! Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kidding you?!
    You loved him didn't you? (No!)
    Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fucking lie to me!
    What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
    Fuck you asshole! Yeah, bite me!
    Kim, Kim! Why don't you like me? You think I'm ugly, don't you?
    (It's not that!) No, you think I'm ugly (Baby)
    Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me!
    I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!
    Oh my God, I love you! How the fuck could you do this to me?!
    (I'm sorry!) How the fuck could you do this to me?!
    So long, bitch you did me so wrong
    I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
    Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared!)
    I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair!)
    (Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you!)
    (Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!)
    Fuck you! You did this to us! You did it! it's your fault!
    Oh my God, I'm cracking up, get a grip Marshall!
    Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
    And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
    That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes) That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
    See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
    You and your husband have a fight
    One of you tries to grab a knife, and during the struggle
    He accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced! (No!)
    And while this is going on, his son just woke up and he walks in
    She panics and he gets his throat cut! (Oh my God!)
    So now they both dead, and you slash your own throat
    So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note!
    I should've known better when you started to act weird
    We coulda... hey, where you going? Get back here!
    You can't run from me Kim! It's just us, nobody else!
    You're only making this harder on yourself!
    Ha-ha, got ya! Go ahead, yell!
    Here, I'll scream with you! "Ah, somebody help!"
    Don't you get it bitch? No one can hear you!
    Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you!
    You were supposed to love me!!
    Now bleed bitch, bleed!! Bleed bitch, bleed!! Bleed!!
    So long, bitch you did me so wrong
    I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
    So long, bitch you did me so wrong

    When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my mom
    Socked her right in her eyeball
    I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
    With all the pictures that I draw
    Shit that I've already witnessed, this probably twisted my thoughts
    All I can hear is drama with mom and him
    I can always hear arguin' down the hallways
    The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
    My dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
    Doctors had to put it down
    He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!
    I, I, hate
    My, my stepdad (stepdad)
    So tonight I'm sayin', bye-bye stepdad (stepdad)
    Outside, I look like I'm calm
    Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
    'Cause of this motherfucker
    Who sticks his dick in my mom (my mom)
    Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
    But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
    Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted 69 times
    He swatted me with it, I'm cryin'
    He just started hittin' me harder
    God, I just wish I could just jaw him
    If I could just get my weight up
    But I'm just a second grader
    This prick is bigger than I am
    But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
    I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
    Sneak up with a lethal injection
    And put him down like they did to my dog
    I'm talkin' euthanasia, like kids in Taiwan
    This fuckin' shit's like Saigon
    Neighbors called police on him
    So many battery charges, dude's like lithium-ion
    Then mom and him let bygones (bygones)
    Just be bygones
    So on eggshells, I walk and just try and not to piss this guy off
    But this why I
    I, I, hate
    My, my stepdad (stepdad)
    So tonight I'm sayin', bye-bye stepdad (stepdad)
    So this year, I'm goin' to the fifth and I'm tall
    I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
    Way bigger fish to fry
    Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
    The handle and wait for the fist to fly off to put this guy in a pine box
    He's always lookin' for cash but tonight I've cooked up a plan
    So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
    I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
    He walks by kicks my arm and goes, whoops, and just laughs
    I yelled for mom (mom) and now she's rushin' to my defense
    I stood up and said, fuck you punk, and I took off and ran
    To my bedroom, as I fled
    Knowin' shit would hit the fan
    Slammed the door and hid behind it with the aluminum bat
    He kicked it in
    I swung it as hard as I could at his head
    His noodle went splat, he fell at the foot of my bed
    I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
    I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
    Beat him with my bare hands
    The big bad wolf ain't so bad
    Ding-dong, the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
    Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two liter with
    Then buried him next to my dog
    And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em
    I, I, hate
    My, my stepdad (stepdad)
    So tonight I'm sayin', bye-bye stepdad (stepdad)
    'Cause I, I, hate
    My, my stepdad (stepdad)
    So tonight I'm sayin', bye-bye stepdad (stepdad)`,

    lyrics: `I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    Yeah
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    It's been a ride
    Everybody (everybody)
    I guess I had to go to that place
    Come take my hand (come take my hand)
    To get to this one
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Now some of you might still be in that place
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    If you're tryna get out (just lettin' you know that you're not alone)
    Just follow me (holla if you feel like you've been down the same road)
    I'll get you there
    You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
    But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
    'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
    When I say I'm a do somethin', I do it
    I don't give a damn what you think
    I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
    It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
    I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
    And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
    No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
    From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album he's still shittin'
    Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
    Whichever comes first, for better or worse
    He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
    His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
    And fuck the whole universe
    I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    Everybody (everybody)
    Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
    Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
    Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
    I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
    You said you was king
    You lied through your teeth, for that, fuck your feelings
    Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
    I'll never let you down again, I'm back
    I promise to never go back on that promise
    In fact, let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was eh
    Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
    Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
    All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack, blaow, 'cause I ain't playin' around
    There's a game called circle and I don't know how
    I'm way too up to back down
    But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
    Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
    Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
    These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
    I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    Everybody (everybody)
    Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
    Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
    And I just can't keep living this way
    So starting today
    I'm breaking out of this cage
    I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
    I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
    I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
    Time to put my life back together right now (now)
    It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
    Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
    So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
    And don't realize what you did, ('cause) believe me you
    I been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
    I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
    My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
    No more beef lingers, no more drama from now on
    I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
    So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
    You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
    I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
    And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
    I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not
    I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    Everybody (everybody)
    Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    Just lettin' you know that you're not alone

    Got out of bed at all
    The morning rain clouds up my window (window)
    And I can't see at all
    And even if I could it'll all be gray
    But your picture on my wall
    It reminds me, that it's not so bad
    It's not so bad
    Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
    I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
    I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
    There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
    Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
    But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
    My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
    If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
    I'ma name her Bonnie
    I read about your uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
    I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
    I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
    I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
    I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
    I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
    Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
    Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
    This is Stan
    My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
    Got out of bed at all
    The morning rain clouds up my window (window)
    And I can't see at all
    And even if I could it'll all be gray
    But your picture on my wall
    It reminds me, that it's not so bad
    It's not so bad
    Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
    I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
    If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
    You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
    That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
    We waited in the blistering cold for you
    For four hours and you just said, "No"
    That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
    He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
    I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
    Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
    See, I'm just like you in a way
    I never knew my father neither
    He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
    I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
    So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
    'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
    I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
    Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
    It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
    See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
    My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
    But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
    She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me, man
    I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
    Sincerely yours, Stan
    P.S. we should be together too
    My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
    Got out of bed at all
    The morning rain clouds up my window (window)
    And I can't see at all

    It reminds me, that it's not so bad
    It's not so bad
    Dear Mr. I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans
    This will be the last package I ever send your ass
    It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
    I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
    So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
    I'm in the car right now, I'm doing ninety on the freeway
    Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
    You dare me to drive?
    You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
    About that guy who could have saved that other guy from drowning
    But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
    That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
    Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
    And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
    I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
    I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
    You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
    And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
    I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
    See Slim, shut up bitch, I'm tryna talk
    Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
    But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
    'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
    Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
    Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
    My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
    Got out of bed at all
    The morning rain clouds up my window (window)
    And I can't see at all
    And even if I could it'll all be gray
    But your picture on my wall
    It reminds me, that it's not so bad
    It's not so bad
    Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
    You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
    Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
    And here's an autograph for your brother
    I wrote it on a Starter cap
    I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
    Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
    But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
    I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
    You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
    To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
    And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
    That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
    I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
    Or maybe you just need to treat her better
    I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
    Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
    If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
    Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
    I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
    I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
    Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
    And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
    And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
    Come to think about, his name was, it was you
    Damn!`,

    lyrics: `Man, these rappers so typical
    I drop a smash record
    All these rappers so miniscule
    It's funny how they compare me to niggas
    Who've hit their pinnacle
    If I don't buy my mom a house this year
    I'm going cynical
    I don't need publicity
    Cause Eagle got the recipe
    All I used to score was A's back in high school
    Don't be testing me
    Back when I was growing up
    Gang signs they were throwing up
    Rappers say they in the game
    And I don't see 'em showin' up
    Went from blowing trees
    To being on joints with OGs
    But I'm connected to this money like my paper siamese
    And I make these niggas grab a hearse
    And when I'm on a feature
    Make these niggas change their verse
    God dammit
    Man what happened to rap Say, say what happened to rap
    Hip hop used to drop bars and now we just dance
    It's now or never, never
    It's time to change the game
    Whatever happended to clever rappin
    The heads is askin'
    Now instead of passion, the level is trash to get
    The cash in
    The question I'm asking: Did it die with the
    Veterans back then?
    Or does it live residing inside irrelevant has been
    Like the Proverb dude, but I know the truth
    That's why I jump in a vocal booth
    To show to you how to mould the truth into
    Multiple quotable
    Put soul in the booth
    Using flow as a tool
    Heads enrol in my school
    I show and I prove
    Just how the oldest do, they still the coldest too
    (Damn)
    And I did it so comfortably
    My scripture are humble pieces
    Rumble in that jungle steez
    There's no denying
    That I bury it a hundred feet
    And the level is higher once the DJ Switch to
    Ganja Beats
    Eish, but they turnin' up and they turnin' up
    Nothing wrong with that
    But their songs is wack and we learning what!
    Hands have gone higher
    If like me you've heard enough
    Then we should build a bonfire of all their tracks
    And burn 'em up
    It's now or never, never
    It's time to change the game, game
    Man, what happened to rap (Ga'ahd Body)
    Man, what happened to rap
    Forget a now or never it's now or forever,
    Forever and ever
    They feel the presence every year like the
    Month of December
    To make sure you don't forget
    I got much to remember
    Only because I give a F like I'm Juju Malema
    To you who enter with new perceptions choose
    Your dilemas
    Do what you do how you do it or do what the
    Rest does
    Either way, know you're going toe to toe with
    The Kwestas, the Xs
    And that's just you keeping up with the
    Kardashians
    The birth of greatness so feel the contractions
    Exceeded all expectations by a certain
    Percentage
    And STILL earn the respect I deserve
    And I get the real deals
    Surrounded by plastic like a Jordans 11
    Original copy for now and forever
    You duplicates should copy me now or will never
    Then we'll all be one and the same like Euphonik
    And Themba
    The difference is I'm driven 'cause I know it's
    Now or never
    It's now or never, never

    I'm on beast mode

    The guy to dethrone
    Still I'm a king though
    I'm key, bored niggas come around just to c-

    I eat off words B
    Your crumbs don't serve me
    You all tweet like birdies
    Your thumbs don't scare me
    So please you all better be done, early
    Or else I put a hole in one, Ernie

    I don't wanna be like this
    I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
    But I'm only being real when I say
    Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (nope)
    And old men have heart attacks
    And I don't wanna be responsible for that
    So put the mic down and walk away
    You can still have a little bit of dignity
    I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
    An 83 year old fake Pacino
    So how can he hold me over some balcony
    Without throwin' his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me? (Ugh)
    Please don't, you'll probably fall with me
    And our asses'll both be history
    But then again, you'd finally get your wish
    'Cause you'll be all over the street like 50 Cent
    You fuckin' punk pussy, fuck you, chump
    Give me a one-on-one, see if I don't fuck you up
    Tried to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
    And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck
    Dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin'
    You sit behind a fuckin' desk at The Source butt-kissin'
    And beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances
    And you can't even get the clearances
    'Cause real lyricists don't even respect you or take you serious
    It's not that we don't like you, we hate you, period
    Talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
    Last week you was shakin' Obie Trice's hand
    Now he's a busta? What the fuck's with that?
    Get on a track dissin' us, kissin' 50's ass
    And askin' me what I know about indictments, bite me
    Bitch, I got two cases, and probation, fight me
    What do I know about standin' in front of a judge like a man
    Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
    What you know about your wife slicin' her wrists
    Right in front of the only thing that you have in this world, a little girl?
    And I put that on her, when this is all over
    I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
    I don't know shit about no choppin' rocks
    But what you know about Hip Hop Shops rockin' spots?
    When you're the only white boy up in that bitch just rippin'
    Pressin' up your own fliers and your stickers, stickin'
    Them bitches up after spendin' six hours at Kinkos
    Just makin' copies of your covers of cassette singles
    To sell 'em out the trunk of your Tracer
    Spendin' your whole paychecks at Disc Makers

    Oh, that's right, you should know what that's like, you're half white
    Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice
    I'm eatin' you alive inside, Jesus Christ
    If you're that much of a gangster, put the mic down
    You should be out killin' motherfuckers right now
    Kill a motherfucker dead, kill 'em dead, bitch
    Shoot'em in the fuckin' head, go ahead, bitch
    Slap my mom, slap the fuck out of her
    She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of you
    'Cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fuckin' joke
    If you was really sellin' coke, well, then what the fuck
    You stop for, dummy? If you slew some crack
    You'd make a lot more money than you do from rap
    You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
    You'll never now what it's like to be rich, life's a bitch ain't it?

    Just to make sure that you can understand us
    And Canibus ain't usin' too many complicated fuckin' words for you
    Here, and let me slow it down for you

    Bitch, you attacked me first
    Take it like a man, and shut the fuck up
