    lyrics: `Oh, when it all (yeah)
It all falls down (this the real one, baby)
I'm tellin' you all (uh)
It all falls down (Chi-Town, stand up)
Oh, when it all (Southside, Southside)
It all falls down (we gon' set this party off right)
I'm tellin' you all (Westside, Westside)
It all falls down, oh, when it all (we gon' set this party off right)
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair"
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well
Oh, when it all, it all falls down (uh)
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all (c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down
And when it falls down, oh, when it all (and when it all falls down)
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this"
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
Oh, when it all (c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down (and when it falls down, who you gon' call now?)
I'm tellin' you all (come on, come on)
It all falls down, oh, when it all (and when it all falls down)
I say, "Fuck the police, " that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with twenty-five thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
'Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it
Oh, when it all (yeah, c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down (and when it falls down, who you gon' call now?)
I'm tellin' you all (c'mon, c'mon)
It all falls down (and when it falls down)
Oh, when it all (Southside, Southside)
It all falls down (we gon' set this party off right)
I'm tellin' you all (Westside, Westside)
It all falls down (we gon' set this party off right)
Oh, when it all (Chi-Town, Chi-Town)
It all falls down (We gon' show 'em how we get down)
I'm tellin' you all (Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt)
It all falls down (you saved my life, c'mon)
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
I's can't keep workin' like this
This grave shift is like a slave ship

    name: "Do For Love",
    artist: "2pac",
    lyrics: `I shoulda seen you was trouble right from the start
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin' at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out, let's throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like, where can I be? You're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love (that's right)
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love (sucka for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (no, baby)
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin' promises to you, tryna keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost (ooh-oh)
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin' low, losin' control
My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear 'cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you've been cheatin', I'm a sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love (sucka for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (don't give up)
What you won't do, do for love (oh yeah, sucka for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (no, baby)
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hopin' the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own (own)
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry 'bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure (yeah)
Make a decision cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love (what you won't do for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (every little thing)
What you won't do, do for love (you don won't do for love, my pretty baby)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (no)
What you won't do, do for love (I'm sucka for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (oh-ooh, oh)
What you won't do, do for love (sucka for love)
You tried everything (sucka for love), but you don't give up (oh)
What you won't do, do for love (do)
You tried everything (every little thing, babe), but you don't give up (no)
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up (do for love)
Yeah baby, yeah

    name: "Bad Meets Evil",
    artist: "Eminem",
    lyrics: `I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
20 years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold-blood
That old saloon there was their little home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night, you can still hear
The footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9"

I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And the noise is spread
Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (Uhh)
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead (Ohh)
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said (Yo)
Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity
Holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level
Is hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist
Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation
Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth

'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
We hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either
Shit, me neither

We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle (Ahh)
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up
And I'm pissed off, 'cause I can't find a decent vein
The disaster with dreads, I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man, until they joint chains
While slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees
Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me
From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt

Hello? (Billy?)
Ayo, what’s up? (We're comin' to get you)
Stop, they know it's us

I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (Uh-uh)
I'm the one who burned your house down (Oh)
Well, I'm out now (Shit)
And this time, I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel
(We'll be waiting) See you in Hell (Uh-huh)
Wall Street (Yup), Royce Da 5'9", Slim Shady (Uh)
See you in Hell for the sequel (Bye-bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what? (Until next time)

And so, that's the story of when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin' out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on 'til this day
Shh, wait, did y'all hear that?

    lyrics: `I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!

Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
that get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothing without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressing the mass public
My attitude was "fuck it," because motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, hoe!"
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feeling crucial
From player to player the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers
To breaking motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin'
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, I catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble

Peep it, it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride
I was the first off this side, give me the 9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screaming as they drill me
But I'm hard to kill (that's all you niggas got?)
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinking thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrificin'
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man
And pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble

My murderous lyrics
Equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops
'Cause I know they coming for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me, but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch ass niggas on my team, so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest! A hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
the cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water

There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you scweamin' in her ear (Mama)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee
There goes Mama, spashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us, just the two of us

Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that

    lyrics: `If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road
And now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up where I started from

I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know, between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose
'Til more shows, haunted you nights, I suppose
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire and—

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall, I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked, I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that? Who would'a even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me?
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life-altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)

Ha, ha, yeah right, bitch
Spend some time on my dick

In most cases, Stat's attitude is, "Fuck a bitch!"
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
We sufferin' because of this
Shawty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who could've predicted to know
Your trifling ways would'a stopped our growth?
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself: "Do I love these hoes?" — Nope!

(Yeah) Em introduced us: "50, this is Tanya, Tanya, this is 50"
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, "You have very nice lips."
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk, when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit? (Ha-ha!)

Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

Hear the screams from everywhere (Yeah)
I'm addicted to the thrill (I'm ready)
It's a dangerous love affair (What's up? Come on)
Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now (What's up?)
Only thing that's on my mind (What's up?)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (Ah, what's up?)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (Yeah, what's up? Yeah)
We gon' run this town

We are, yeah, I said it, we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is La Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up

Life's a game, but it's not fair (Yeah)
I break the rules, so I don't care (Uh-huh)
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain (What's up?)

Almost there, don't give up now (What's up?)

Hey, hey, hey, hey (What's up?)

You can call me Caesar in a dark Caesar
Please follow the leader, so Eric B we are
Microphone fiend, this the return of the god
Peace, God, ah ah, it ain't no nobody fresher
I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
On the table, screamin', "Fuck the other side! They jealous!"
We got a banquette full of broads, they got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in 'cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like Millionaires' Row

Life's a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain

Hey, hey, hey, hey

It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick; no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life Good Will Hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
"What's that, Ye?" "Baby, these heels"
"Is that a May— what?!" "Baby, these wheels"
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel (What’s up?)

Hey, hey (Yeah, yeah)

He'll look around the room, but won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid, yeah
He found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet, and with a box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
Daddy works a long day
He'd be coming home late, yeah, he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen, and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
Then say, "Your hair's on fire, you must have lost your wits, yeah"
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks

Well, you talk like yourself
No, I hear someone else though
Now you're making me nervous
You were the better part
Of every bit of beating heart that I had
Whatever I had
I finally sat alone
Pitch black flesh and bone
Couldn't believe that you were gone

These streets remind me of quicksand
When you're on it, you'll keep goin' down
And there's no one to hold on to
And there's no one to pull you out
You keep on fallin', no one can hear you callin'
So you end up self-destructin'
On the corner with the toolie on the waist line
Just got up out the thing doin' state time
Teeth marks on my back from the K-9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
‘Cause they said that I wouldn't make it
I remember like yesterday
Holdin' on to what God gave me

‘Cause that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
And eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto)
Ghetto, that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
And eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto)

No need to cherish luxuries
‘Cause everything come and go
Even the life that you have is borrowed
‘Cause you're not promised tomorrow
So live your life as if every day is gon' be your last
Once you've moved forward
You can't go back just to remove your past
‘Cause you gotta be willin' to pray
Yes, there gotta be, there gotta be a better way
Yes, you gotta be willin' to pray
‘Cause there gotta be, there gotta be a better day
Whoever said that the struggle would stop today?
A lot a niggas dead or locked away
Teenage women growin' up with AIDS

‘Cause that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto)
Ghetto, that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto)

Gun shots every night in the (ghetto)
Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto)
Everyday is a fight in the (ghetto)
Oh oh oh oh oh (ghetto livin')
Got kids to feed in the (ghetto)
Sellin' coke and weed in the (ghetto)

You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting, doing my two step fronting
Now I'ma tell you what Em told me, homie
Just lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumping, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's fo sho
I got the info you already know
Man, I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go

You know I got what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now, shorty, let's get into it
You, know I got what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homie, let's get into it

You wanna search me, then search me, but hurry up, 'cause I'm thirsty
I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways, let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some Pac shit these tricks'll frame ya (Word)
But, in any event, keep fuckin' with 50 it makes sense
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holla
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I don’t say nothin, let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club, feed them liquor otherwise we starve 'em
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go

You know I got what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now, shorty, let's get into it
You, know I got what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homie, let's get into it

You already know how it go, I bang, I shine
I play, I stay I'm going for mine
I'm young, I'm black, I'm rich and yes
I'm ghetto than the motherfucking project steps
I'm cool, I'm calm you looking real stressed
I'm strapped I'm armed kid, hold your head
I'm known for gat popping, when I got problems
I don't run, I just gun you all up
But we ain't come here to start no drama
We just looking for our future baby mamas
With money with face with style and body
I cook I clean I swear that mami
Just as long as you don't go off and tell nobody
I go down low, I'm lying I'm trying my best to let you know
Sugar pop get at P
The Doc beat make it easy to get 'em in the bed sheets

You know I got what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now, shorty, let's get into it

So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord

And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, I remember, I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time
The last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No, you don't fool me
Well, the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord

Oh, Lord

You know the chronicles, the shit that if mama knew
The stress the drama do, the TECs phenomenal
Rapid fire, it pecks through the abdominal
You bastard liars, it's me who's the honorable
Bathed and clothed up, shaved and close cut
Restraint from temptation was drained from both nuts
Heh now the physical form, verbalize through the scriptures, I was Biblically born
It's I'ah Jeremiah, concieved through the blunt fire
On Kawasaki's can wheelie up on one tire
Well respected, jail connected, got the method for the pretty females perfected
For sure, very few flaws, heavy Chevy two-doors
Candy paint, it'll give a nigga the blue balls
Pause, this the life I chose
Done did the 360, the cypher's closed, common
The format is real sickening, contagious
Here I come, AZ
Still, I don't have to run no game, I've done those things
Young and gifted, my tongue's prolific
In the beached bungalow is how I brung in Christmas
From the streets I'ma flow from the hungriest districts
Swiss kicks, crisp when I come to them picnics
Play it slow, paper chase, stack, and lay low
Range Rove, tinted all black, the same old
Psychic mind, righteous ryhmes
Still turn the new leaf on my life of crime
No concerns with new beef who's as nice as I'm
It's confirmed, from few feet I'm still a sniper blind
Built my fame, spilt my pain
Politicking daily, still tryin' to milk the game
It's obvious that I'm real rap skills remain
I took some change and I'm still the same
The format is real sickening, contagious
Here I come, AZ
Still, I don't have to run no game, I've done those things
Learnt the system, burned some izm
Jotted my jewels down like journalism
How I maneuve now, it'll merge the wisdom
A pilgrim, prophesize putting words to rhythm
Relating, I Adam Clayton it, manifestation, patient
Meditatin' with them animals waitin', pacin'
Like an inmate that sealed his fate
Let some years escape, but I'm still in shape
I'm chilling, deeply rooted, a beast with music
From Bed-Stuy to the East, I'm too at peace to lose it
But love it, I still does it, breathing off a Trump budget
Fresh out of Bloomies with the Louis luggage
The format is real sickening, contagious
Here I come, AZ
Here you go, how we get down
The format is real sickening, contagious
Here I come, AZ
Here you go, how we get down

To my man, Killer B
No doubt indeed
Where that weed?
Knam'sayin'?
That old real shit
There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, 'cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, 'cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me
The Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say so it's left a untold fact
Until my death, my goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
I'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low the jewels go
But never that, as long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged
That fucked me up, God, but shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples
When you're upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two to four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, 'cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get
I'm stayin' in the projects forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot, fuck lookin' cute!
I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders

We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas

Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless

And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day

When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em

I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?
'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song

I think I might be a-okay
If I wait just another day
I got to tell ya
Getting blinded by the lights
I got to tell ya
'Bout the chaos in my mind
I got to tell ya
All these nights we're not together
Forgot to tell ya (yeah)
Forgot to tell ya
I got to tell you, I ain't tryna make no promise
Not nothing that could weigh down conscious
Pay the bills and the rest fill pockets
Still sometimes you be obnoxious
Just want it different when I'm having you around me
All night, no sleep, we down here
Whenever we here, no problems
Losing track o' time, 'til it finds us (yeah)
Down with ya 'til I make me a thousand
White picket fences, pool house loungin'
Sounding good to me if you round with it
I kill the demons we hit the ground running
My stress gon' need a vest round the chest
Reshape my world in seven days or less
On the chase like the days, chased ice cream trucks
Got us moving fast but it's never enough
Yeah, I know that the weather is rough
But it won't stop us
Yeah, shit is never enough
I got to tell ya
Getting blinded by the lights
I got to tell ya
'Bout the chaos in my mind
I got to tell ya
All these nights we're not together
Forgot to tell ya
Forgot to tell ya
I got to tell ya
Getting blinded by the lights
I got to tell ya
'Bout the chaos in my mind
I got to tell ya
All these nights we're not together
Forgot to tell ya
Forgot to tell ya
I got to tell ya
Getting blinded by the lights
I got to tell ya
'Bout the chaos in my mind
I got to tell ya
All these nights we're not together
Forgot to tell ya
Forgot to tell ya

Nigga, why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for you, either way it go
Tell me, girl, why you be stressin' me for time? (Time, time, time, time, time, time)
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn, my nigga, why you actin' like a bitch? (Bitch, bitch, bitch)
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here, baby, why you always insecure? ('Cure, cure, cure, cure, cure, cure)
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

Yeah, ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fadin' you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My Uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, 'cause niggas say they the one
And I got somethin' to prove
Forgive me, Lord, here they come, blaow

Come here, baby, why you always insecure? ('Cure, cure, cure, cure, cure, cure)
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

My inhibition's fightin' my intuition
Premature premonition, showin' me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscin'
You want the truth? Well, come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked your phone and saw it was a number missin'
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fried, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole, you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me, blaow

Nigga, why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for you, either way it go
Tell me, girl, why you be stressin' me for time? (Time, time, time, time, time, time)

(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom, nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt (Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
(Who's the king?)
You tell me you still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know (Who's the king?)
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it (Yeah)

Listen, history repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each other's flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock 'n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang, nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

We all kings (We all kings, nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game (Hehehaha)
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it (True)
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a bang, the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gon' be no more kings (Ain't gon' be no more kings)
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power (Mm)
In reality he's a coward (Mm)
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side (The other side, ayy)
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I (Yessir)
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God (It's only one God, nigga)
It's for all the kings (Uh)
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved

Fish scale, yeah, I got these bitches on the bait
Don't wanna talk, man, they say, I need some space
Woop, woop, woop, my new car geeked up
I just paid a cop, now I'm runnin' out of court
Panoramic top, I'ma put it on the rocks
Crawl, walk and hop, got all of these bitches shocked
Ayy, stone molly whiter than my socks
I don't, I don't wanna talk if it ain't 'bout guap

Smoke somethin' with a G and bend that ass backwards
Lay back, relax and talk mathematics
Later on, we test a little sex practice
Write my name on the wall
Money in the mattress, bet she wanna get involved
She hopped on the blunt, say, "Where the hookah y'all?"
I tell her pass back if the shit too strong, it's all set
Mozart art on the block, so wet
I got her where I want her and I ain't done yet
Lookin' at your future, baby, put down the cigarette
Come hop on this kush jet and take flight, yeah
Tell them bitches, "Hmm, fuck that"
You with Aladdin, bet I got a magic carpet for that ass, yes
I'm also on one, got two Olsen's on me
Big homie, Young Thugger Thugger, rollin'

Pass me the hookah, pass the hookah, pass the hookah
Ah, Ben Frank baddies in the Benz Wagon
You know she want a ride home, hop on the band wagon
I got the chain saggy, you know that life lavish
Lifestyles like this, gon' need Magnums
Pass baby, welcome to rich class, baby
You all Maybelline, with ya new Celine
Audemars on lean, cars on sheen
You white girl, but black girl ghetto fly thing
It's verified, they ain't on your sea level
Watered eyes, don't cry, inhale and breathe regular
My baby on it, high in the crack of dawnin'
Body shape, figure eight, like Picasso draw ya
Oh, yes, I'm winnin', bling kingin', ring blingin'
Like, like, for no reason, let's get closer, closed in
Remove your clothes, we close friends
Don't get choked smokin' OG Oakland, shout out Oakland

    lyrics: `Oh
    Put your loving hand out, baby
    I'm beggin'
    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, baby
    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, darling
    Riding high, when I was king
    Played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
    Walked away, wonderin' then
    But easy come and easy go
    And it would end
    So ah, any time I need ya, let me go
    Every time I reach, you get me low
    Every time I seek, you let me know
    But I planted that seed, just let me grow
    I'm on my knees while I'm (beggin')
    'Cause I don't wanna lose (you)
    I got my arms all spread
    I hope that my heart gets fed
    Matter of fact, girl, I'm beggin' (beggin', beggin')
    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, baby
    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, darling
    I need you (yeah) to understand
    Tried so hard (hey) to be your man
    The kind of man (oh) you want in the end
    Only then can I begin to live again
    An empty shell I used to be
    Shadow of my life was hangin' over me
    A broken man that I don't know
    Won't even stand the devil's chance to win my soul
    What we doing? What we chasing?
    Why the bottom? Why the basement?
    Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
    Why the feel for the need to replace me?
    You're on a runway track from the good
    I wanna paint in a picture telling where we could be at
    Like the heart ain't attached where it should
    You done give it away, I had it 'til you took it back
    But I keep walking on, keep opening doors
    Keep hoping for that the call is yours
    Keep hoes on hold
    'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
    Girl, I'm beggin' (beggin', beggin')
    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, baby
    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, darling
    I'm fighting hard (yeah)
    To hold my own (hold my own)
    Just can't make it
    All alone (all alone)
    I'm holding on (yeah)
    Can't fall back (no, I'm fallin')
    I'm just a con (yeah)
    'Bout to fade to black
    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, baby
    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, darling
    Beggin', beggin' you
    Put your loving hand out, baby
    Beggin', beggin' you

    lyrics: `
    Step by step, heart to heart
    Left, right, left, we all fall down...
    Step by step, heart to heart
    Left, right, left, we all fall down
    Like toy soldiers
    Bit by bit, torn apart
    We never win, but the battle wages on
    For toy soldiers
    I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
    Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
    I ain't never supposed to show it
    My crew ain't supposed to know it
    Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
    It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
    'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
    I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
    If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
    That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
    There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
    I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
    It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
    And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
    I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
    And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
    This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
    That was never my object, for someone to get killed
    Why would I wanna destroy somethin' I helped build?
    It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
    I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
    And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
    And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
    Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
    So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
    While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
    Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
    This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
    But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause—
    Step by step, heart to heart
    Left, right, left, we all fall down
    Like toy soldiers
    Bit by bit, torn apart
    We never win, but the battle wages on
    For toy soldiers
    There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
    Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
    But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
    The shit gets escalated—it ain't just words no more, is it?
    It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
    We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
    Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
    And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
    Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
    Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
    Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
    Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
    Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
    Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
    But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
    Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
    Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
    Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
    But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
    That we've just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
    And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
    We still have soldiers that's on the front line
    Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
    Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
    And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
    To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
    It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
    Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
    But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
    It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
    Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
    I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
    But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
    I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
    Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
    I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience
    'Cause—
    Step by step, heart to heart
    Left, right, left, we all fall down
    Like toy soldiers
    Bit by bit, torn apart

    lyrics: `Lately, I've been hard to reach
    I've been too long on my own
    Everybody has a private world
    Where they can be alone
    Are you callin me?
    Are you tryin' to get through?
    Are you reachin' out for me?
    I'm reachin' out for you
    I'm just so fuckin' depressed
    I just can't seem to get out this slump
    If I could just get over this hump
    But I need something to pull me out this dump
    I took my bruises, took my lumps
    Fell down and I got right back up
    But I need that spark to get psyched back up
    In order for me to pick the mic back up
    I don't know how or why or when
    And I ended up in this position I'm in
    I'm startin' to feel distant again
    So I decided just to pick this pen
    Up and tried to make an attempt to vent
    But I just can't admit
    Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
    I need a new outlet
    And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
    But I just can't sit back and wallow
    In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
    I'll be one tough act to follow
    One tough act to follow
    I'll be one tough act to follow
    Here today, gone tomorrow
    But you'd have to walk a thousand miles
    In my shoes, just to see
    What it's like to be me
    I'll be you, let's trade shoes
    Just to see what it'd be like to
    Feel your pain, you feel mine
    Go inside each other's minds
    Just to see what we find
    Look at shit through each other's eyes
    But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
    Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (yeah, so)
    I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor
    Everything's so tense and gloom
    I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
    Of the room, just as soon as
    I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
    So I try to avoid any eye contact
    'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
    For conversation like I want that
    I'm not lookin' for extra attention
    I just wanna be just like you
    Blend in with the rest of the room
    Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
    I don't need no fuckin' manservant
    Tryna follow me around, and wipe my ass
    Laugh at every single joke I crack
    And half of 'em ain't even funny like
    "Ha, Marshall, you're so funny, man
    You should be a comedian, goddamn"
    Unfortunately I am
    I just hide behind the tears of a clown
    So why don't you all sit down
    Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
    Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
    And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
    In my shoes, just to see
    What it's like to be me
    I'll be you, let's trade shoes
    Just to see what it'd be like to
    Feel your pain, you feel mine
    Go inside each other's minds
    Just to see what we find
    Look at shit through each other's eyes
    But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
    Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
    Nobody asked for life to deal us
    With these bullshit hands we're dealt
    We gotta take these cards ourselves
    And flip 'em, don't expect no help
    Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
    Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
    And get up and get my own
    I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
    Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
    For a dad to show up who never did
    I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
    I dreamed of being that cool kid
    Even if it meant actin' stupid
    Aunt Edna always told me
    "Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that"
    Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
    Holding my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
    'Til I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
    I learned my lesson then
    'Cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
    But I already told you my whole life story
    Not just based on my description
    'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
    Is probably 110% different
    I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
    What size you wear? I wear 10's
    Let's see if you can fit your feet
    In my shoes, just to see
    What it's like to be me
    I'll be you, let's trade shoes
    Just to see what it'd be like to
    Feel your pain, you feel mine
    Go inside each other's minds
    Just to see what we find
    Look at shit through each other's eyes
    But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
    Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh-oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
    Lately, I've been hard to reach
    I've been too long on my own (oh-oh)
    Everybody has a private world
    Where they can be alone (so)
    Are you callin' me?
    Are you tryin' to get through? (oh-oh)
    Are you reachin' out for me?
    Then I'm reachin' out for you (so)
    Yeah, to my babies, stay strong
    Dad'll be home soon
    And to the rest of the world
    God gave you them shoes to fit you
    So put 'em on and wear 'em
    Be yourself, man
    Be proud of who you are
    Even if it sounds corny
    Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful (so)`,

    We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
    Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop

    I'm the bossman in the suit with no tie
    I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
    Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
    Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
    Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire

    The latest Mercedes, her go-to surprise
    Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize

    Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
    We really fly, we like pelican glide
    Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
    Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
    She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life

    I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (skrrt)
    Haven't had a sip, that there weed you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, whoa, whoa (yeah, yeah)
    I'm strapped up, I'm cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (doo-doo-doo-doo)
    I'm in the coupe by myself
    I had to kick a door when I was five
    Keep the old ones on the shelf
    Whole sixteen round in the fire
    I'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies
    Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys

    Hate in my heart, love in my mind
    I seen nights full of pain, days of the same
    You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
    And I search but never find, hurt but never cry
    I work and forever try but I'm cursed, so never mind
    And it's worse but better times seem further and beyond
    The top gets higher the more that I climb
    The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
    Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
    But soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
    'Cause all this bullshit just make me strong, motherfucker

    Just hope you're heaven-sent and you're hell-proof

    And confidence is the stain they can't wipe off
    Huh, My word is my pride
    But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
    Served to survive, murdered and bribed
    And when it got too heavy, I put my burdens aside
    So I could pick the world up
    And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head (haha)

    It hurts but I never show, this pain you'll never know
    If only you could see, just how lonely and how cold
    And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
    When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream, "Fuck 'em all"!
    Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
    This roof is cavin' in
    Uh, it's time to raise it, then
    Your days are numbered like pages in
    My book of rhymes got 'em cookin'
    Boy, this crooked mind of mine got 'em
    All shook and scared to look in my eyes
    I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I
    Came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
    And butt-fucked this game up
    Better be careful when you bring my name up
    Fuck this fame, that ain't what
    I came to claim but the game ain't
    Gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
    But I swear one way or another
    I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe that
    I swear to God, won't spare the rod
    I'm a man of my word so your fuckin' heads better nod
    Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
    Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
    Permanently, bitch, it's beddy bye
    This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die
    My head is swolle', my confidence is up
    This stage is my pedestal, I'm an unstoppable
    Incredible Hulk - you're trapped in my medicine ball
    I could run circles around you so fast
    Your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
    I split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'
    Pick the world up
    And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
    Yeah, bitch, I'ma pick the world up

    I'd rather die than you not be by my side
    Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
    Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
    Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde, nah
    On the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
    I, felt like my, whole relationship with you was a lie
    It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
    Cause if you coulda, took my life you woulda
    It's like you put a, knife through my chest
    And pushed it right through to the, other side
    Of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
    Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
    At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
    Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
    Bite me bitch, chew on a nineteen footer
    Cause this morning I finally stood up
    Held my chin up, finally showed a sign
    Of life in me for the, first time since you left me
    And left me with nothing but shattered dreams
    And the life we coulda, had and we could've been
    But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
    Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
    I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
    I'ma be late for the pity party
    But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
    Took it on the chin like a champ
    So don't lump me in with the chump-ions
    I'm done being your punching bag
    It was the November 31st today
    Would've been our anniversary
    Two years but you left on the 1st of May

    But couldn't think of the words to say
    But they came to me just now
    So I put 'em in a verse to lay
    And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was
    But I hate you cause you drained me, I gave you all, you gave me none
    But if you blame me, you're crazy and after all is said and done
    I'm still angry, yeah, I may be, I may never trust someone
    But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was
    Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you

    lyrics: `Aww, look at daddy's baby girl
    That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
    Yesterday I changed your diaper, wiped you and powdered you
    How did you get so big? Can't believe it, now you're two
    Baby you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
    Sit down bitch! You move again I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay)
    Don't make me wake this baby! She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!
    Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
    How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
    Oh, what's the matter Kim, am I too loud for you?!
    Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
    At first, I'm like: "Aight, you wanna throw me out; that's fine!"
    But not for him to take my place! Are you out your mind?!
    This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
    How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
    Look at your husband now! (No!) I said, look at him!
    He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?!
    (Why are you doing this?!) Shut the fuck up!
    (You're drunk! You're never gonna get away with this!)
    You think I give a fuck?! Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!)
    Sit up front! (We can't just leave Hailie alone! What if she wakes up?)
    We'll be right back; well, I will: you'll be in the trunk!
    So long, bitch you did me so wrong
    I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
    You really fucked me Kim! You really did a number on me!
    Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
    But we was kids then, Kim! I was only eighteen
    That was years ago! I thought we wiped the slate clean
    That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racing
    (I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station!
    I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!)
    There's a year-old little laying dead with a slit throat
    In your living room! Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kidding you?!
    You loved him didn't you? (No!)
    Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fucking lie to me!
    What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
    Fuck you asshole! Yeah, bite me!
    Kim, Kim! Why don't you like me? You think I'm ugly, don't you?
    (It's not that!) No, you think I'm ugly (Baby)
    Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me!
    I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!
    Oh my God, I love you! How the fuck could you do this to me?!
    (I'm sorry!) How the fuck could you do this to me?!
    So long, bitch you did me so wrong
    I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
    Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared!)
    I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair!)
    (Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you!)
    (Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!)
    Fuck you! You did this to us! You did it! it's your fault!
    Oh my God, I'm cracking up, get a grip Marshall!
    Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
    And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
    That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes) That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
    See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
    You and your husband have a fight
    One of you tries to grab a knife, and during the struggle
    He accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced! (No!)
    And while this is going on, his son just woke up and he walks in
    She panics and he gets his throat cut! (Oh my God!)
    So now they both dead, and you slash your own throat
    So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note!
    I should've known better when you started to act weird
    We coulda... hey, where you going? Get back here!
    You can't run from me Kim! It's just us, nobody else!
    You're only making this harder on yourself!
    Ha-ha, got ya! Go ahead, yell!
    Here, I'll scream with you! "Ah, somebody help!"
    Don't you get it bitch? No one can hear you!
    Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you!
    You were supposed to love me!!
    Now bleed bitch, bleed!! Bleed bitch, bleed!! Bleed!!
    So long, bitch you did me so wrong
    I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
    So long, bitch you did me so wrong
    I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you`,

    I can always hear arguin' down the hallways
    The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
    My dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
    Doctors had to put it down
    He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!

    Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
    But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
    Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted 69 times
    He swatted me with it, I'm cryin'
    He just started hittin' me harder
    God, I just wish I could just jaw him
    If I could just get my weight up
    But I'm just a second grader
    This prick is bigger than I am
    But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
    I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
    Sneak up with a lethal injection
    And put him down like they did to my dog
    I'm talkin' euthanasia, like kids in Taiwan
    This fuckin' shit's like Saigon
    Neighbors called police on him
    So many battery charges, dude's like lithium-ion
    Then mom and him let bygones (bygones)
    Just be bygones
    So on eggshells, I walk and just try and not to piss this guy off
    But this why I
    I, I, hate
    My, my stepdad (stepdad)
    So tonight I'm sayin', bye-bye stepdad (stepdad)
    So this year, I'm goin' to the fifth and I'm tall
    I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
    Way bigger fish to fry
    Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
    The handle and wait for the fist to fly off to put this guy in a pine box
    He's always lookin' for cash but tonight I've cooked up a plan
    So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
    I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
    He walks by kicks my arm and goes, whoops, and just laughs
    I yelled for mom (mom) and now she's rushin' to my defense
    I stood up and said, fuck you punk, and I took off and ran
    To my bedroom, as I fled
    Knowin' shit would hit the fan
    Slammed the door and hid behind it with the aluminum bat
    He kicked it in
    I swung it as hard as I could at his head
    His noodle went splat, he fell at the foot of my bed
    I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
    I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
    Beat him with my bare hands
    The big bad wolf ain't so bad
    Ding-dong, the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
    Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two liter with
    Then buried him next to my dog
    And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em
    I, I, hate
    My, my stepdad (stepdad)
    So tonight I'm sayin', bye-bye stepdad (stepdad)
    'Cause I, I, hate
    My, my stepdad (stepdad)
    So tonight I'm sayin', bye-bye stepdad (stepdad)`,

    lyrics: `I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    Yeah
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    It's been a ride
    Everybody (everybody)
    I guess I had to go to that place
    Come take my hand (come take my hand)
    To get to this one
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Now some of you might still be in that place
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    If you're tryna get out (just lettin' you know that you're not alone)
    Just follow me (holla if you feel like you've been down the same road)
    I'll get you there
    You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
    But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
    'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
    When I say I'm a do somethin', I do it
    I don't give a damn what you think
    I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
    It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
    I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
    And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
    No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
    From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album he's still shittin'
    Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
    Whichever comes first, for better or worse
    He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
    His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
    And fuck the whole universe
    I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    Everybody (everybody)
    Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
    Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
    Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
    I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
    You said you was king
    You lied through your teeth, for that, fuck your feelings
    Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
    I'll never let you down again, I'm back
    I promise to never go back on that promise
    In fact, let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was eh
    Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
    Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
    All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack, blaow, 'cause I ain't playin' around
    There's a game called circle and I don't know how
    I'm way too up to back down
    But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
    Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
    Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
    These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
    I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    Everybody (everybody)
    Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
    Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
    And I just can't keep living this way
    So starting today
    I'm breaking out of this cage
    I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
    I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
    I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
    Time to put my life back together right now (now)
    It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
    Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
    So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
    And don't realize what you did, ('cause) believe me you
    I been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
    I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
    My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
    No more beef lingers, no more drama from now on
    I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
    So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
    You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
    I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
    And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
    I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not
    I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    Everybody (everybody)
    Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
    Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road`,

    And even if I could it'll all be gray
    But your picture on my wall
    It reminds me, that it's not so bad
    It's not so bad
    Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
    I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
    If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
    You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
    That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
    We waited in the blistering cold for you
    For four hours and you just said, "No"
    That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
    He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
    I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
    Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
    See, I'm just like you in a way
    I never knew my father neither
    He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
    I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
    So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
    'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
    I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
    Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
    It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
    See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
    My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
    But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
    She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me, man
    I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
    Sincerely yours, Stan
    P.S. we should be together too
    My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
    Got out of bed at all
    The morning rain clouds up my window (window)
    And I can't see at all
    And even if I could it'll all be gray
    But your picture on my wall
    It reminds me, that it's not so bad
    It's not so bad
    Dear Mr. I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans
    This will be the last package I ever send your ass
    It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
    I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
    So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
    I'm in the car right now, I'm doing ninety on the freeway
    Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
    You dare me to drive?
    You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
    About that guy who could have saved that other guy from drowning
    But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
    That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
    Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
    And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
    I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
    I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
    You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
    And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
    I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
    See Slim, shut up bitch, I'm tryna talk
    Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
    But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
    'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
    Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
    Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
    My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
    Got out of bed at all
    The morning rain clouds up my window (window)
    And I can't see at all
    And even if I could it'll all be gray
    But your picture on my wall
    It reminds me, that it's not so bad
    It's not so bad
    Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
    You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
    Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
    And here's an autograph for your brother
    I wrote it on a Starter cap
    I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
    Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
    But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
    I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
    You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
    To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
    And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
    That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
    I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
    Or maybe you just need to treat her better
    I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
    Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
    If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
    Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
    I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
    I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
    Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
    And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
    And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
    Come to think about, his name was, it was you

    lyrics: `Man, these rappers so typical
    I drop a smash record
    All these rappers so miniscule
    It's funny how they compare me to niggas
    Who've hit their pinnacle
    If I don't buy my mom a house this year
    I'm going cynical
    I don't need publicity
    Cause Eagle got the recipe
    All I used to score was A's back in high school
    Don't be testing me
    Back when I was growing up
    Gang signs they were throwing up
    Rappers say they in the game
    And I don't see 'em showin' up
    Went from blowing trees
    To being on joints with OGs
    But I'm connected to this money like my paper siamese
    And I make these niggas grab a hearse
    And when I'm on a feature
    Make these niggas change their verse
    God dammit
    Man what happened to rap Say, say what happened to rap
    Hip hop used to drop bars and now we just dance
    It's now or never, never
    It's time to change the game
    Whatever happended to clever rappin
    The heads is askin'
    Now instead of passion, the level is trash to get
    The cash in
    The question I'm asking: Did it die with the
    Veterans back then?
    Or does it live residing inside irrelevant has been
    Like the Proverb dude, but I know the truth
    That's why I jump in a vocal booth
    To show to you how to mould the truth into
    Multiple quotable
    Put soul in the booth
    Using flow as a tool
    Heads enrol in my school
    I show and I prove
    Just how the oldest do, they still the coldest too
    (Damn)
    And I did it so comfortably
    My scripture are humble pieces
    Rumble in that jungle steez
    There's no denying
    That I bury it a hundred feet
    And the level is higher once the DJ Switch to
    Ganja Beats
    Eish, but they turnin' up and they turnin' up
    Nothing wrong with that
    But their songs is wack and we learning what!
    Hands have gone higher
    If like me you've heard enough
    Then we should build a bonfire of all their tracks
    And burn 'em up
    It's now or never, never
    It's time to change the game, game
    Man, what happened to rap (Ga'ahd Body)
    Man, what happened to rap
    Forget a now or never it's now or forever,
    Forever and ever
    They feel the presence every year like the
    Month of December
    To make sure you don't forget
    I got much to remember
    Only because I give a F like I'm Juju Malema
    To you who enter with new perceptions choose
    Your dilemas
    Do what you do how you do it or do what the
    Rest does
    Either way, know you're going toe to toe with
    The Kwestas, the Xs
    And that's just you keeping up with the
    Kardashians
    The birth of greatness so feel the contractions
    Exceeded all expectations by a certain
    Percentage
    And STILL earn the respect I deserve
    And I get the real deals
    Surrounded by plastic like a Jordans 11
    Original copy for now and forever
    You duplicates should copy me now or will never
    Then we'll all be one and the same like Euphonik
    And Themba
    The difference is I'm driven 'cause I know it's

    Your thumbs don't scare me

    Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (nope)
    And old men have heart attacks
    And I don't wanna be responsible for that
    So put the mic down and walk away
    You can still have a little bit of dignity
    I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
    An 83 year old fake Pacino
    So how can he hold me over some balcony
    Without throwin' his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me? (Ugh)

    And our asses'll both be history

    You fuckin' punk pussy, fuck you, chump
    Give me a one-on-one, see if I don't fuck you up
    Tried to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
    And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck

    And you can't even get the clearances
    'Cause real lyricists don't even respect you or take you serious
    It's not that we don't like you, we hate you, period
    Talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
    Last week you was shakin' Obie Trice's hand
    Now he's a busta? What the fuck's with that?
    Get on a track dissin' us, kissin' 50's ass
    And askin' me what I know about indictments, bite me
    Bitch, I got two cases, and probation, fight me
    What do I know about standin' in front of a judge like a man
    Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
    What you know about your wife slicin' her wrists
    Right in front of the only thing that you have in this world, a little girl?
    And I put that on her, when this is all over
    I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
    I don't know shit about no choppin' rocks
    But what you know about Hip Hop Shops rockin' spots?
    When you're the only white boy up in that bitch just rippin'
    Pressin' up your own fliers and your stickers, stickin'
    Them bitches up after spendin' six hours at Kinkos
    Just makin' copies of your covers of cassette singles
    To sell 'em out the trunk of your Tracer
    Spendin' your whole paychecks at Disc Makers

    Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice
    I'm eatin' you alive inside, Jesus Christ
    If you're that much of a gangster, put the mic down
    You should be out killin' motherfuckers right now
    Kill a motherfucker dead, kill 'em dead, bitch
    Shoot'em in the fuckin' head, go ahead, bitch
    Slap my mom, slap the fuck out of her
    She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of you
    'Cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fuckin' joke
    If you was really sellin' coke, well, then what the fuck
    You stop for, dummy? If you slew some crack
    You'd make a lot more money than you do from rap
    You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
